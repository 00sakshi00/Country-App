To build this app we used HTML, CSS and javascript. Apart from this,[‘Rest Countries’ API](https://restcountries.com/) is used.
 
This app consists of a search bar. The user enters the name of the country to be searched for in this input field and clicks on the search button. On hitting search, app display a list of common information about that country including an image of the country’s flag.
Animations are also done using css.
